# Advanced Statistics
An ongoing graduate course in Sharif University on advanced topics in statistics, following much of the material from Trevor Hastie and Bradley Efron’s *Computer Age Statistical Inference* ([book/site](https://hastie.su.domains/CASI/)).  
Lectured by [Kasra Alishahi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kasra-Alishahi).
## Overview

**Part I — Classical Inference**
- Algorithms and inference  
- Frequentist inference  
- Bayesian inference  
- Fisherian inference and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)  
- Parametric models and the exponential family  

**Part II — Dawn of the Computer Age**
- Empirical Bayes  
- James–Stein estimators and ridge regression  
- Generalized linear models (GLMs) and regression trees  
- Survival analysis and the EM algorithm  
- Jackknife and bootstrap  
- Resampling-based confidence intervals  
- Cross-validation and prediction-error estimation  
- Bayesian inference and MCMC  
- Post-war statistical methods and inference  

**Part III — The 21st Century**
- Multiple testing and the false discovery rate (FDR)  
- Sparse modeling and the LASSO  
- Random forests and boosting  
- Neural networks and deep learning  
- Support vector machines (SVMs) and kernel methods  
- Post-selection inference  
- Empirical-Bayes estimation strategies
