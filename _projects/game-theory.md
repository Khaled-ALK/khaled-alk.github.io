## Overview
I hadn’t planned to take this class, but after attending 2–3 sessions I was hooked. The subject was fascinating, and [Prof. Kasra Alishahi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kasra-Alishahi) did a great job teaching it. The primary text was *[Game Theory Alive](https://www.yuval-peres-books.com/game-theory-alive/)* by one of my favorite mathematicians, [Yuval Peres](https://yuvalperes.com/).

**Coverage:** Mainly the first eight chapters, with the final sessions focused on Chapter 12 (cooperative games).
