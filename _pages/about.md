Hi, I'm Khaled Alekaisr. I recently completed my bachelor's in Computer Science at the University of Tehran.

It's hard to pick a single **main** field, but I'm especially interested in problems with inherent uncertainty and in finding the patterns that describe them.

**Current areas of study**
- Analysis
- Probability theory
- Mathematical finance \ Game Theory
